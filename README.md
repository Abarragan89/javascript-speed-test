# javascript-speed-test

* This is a timed Javascript test. This displays ten questions. The user has 75 seconds to answer all the questions. Once the test is finished, the remaining time is their score. If the user gets a problem incorrect, they lose 10 seconds. On every attempt, questions are randomized as well as their corresponding multiple choice options. The high score is saved in local storage.

* All HTML elements are generated through Javascript functions that interact with the DOM. Only a body tag exists in the HTML index file.
